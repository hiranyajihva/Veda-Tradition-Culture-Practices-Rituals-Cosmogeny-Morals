déva savitaḥ prá suva yajñám prá suva yajñápatim bʰágāya divyó gandʰarváḥ
 ketapū́ḥ ketáṃ naḥ punātu vā́cas pátir vā́cam adyá svadāti naḥ

~ Tāittirīya-saṁhitā́ (1.7.7)

It's in a meter called mahāsatobr̥hatī, a variation of the br̥hatī metre (8 8 12 8). If anyone is interested in knowing, Svadhyaya Mandal Pune lists the r̥ṣi as Soma.

Keith translates it as:

"a O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice for good luck; 
may the divine Gandharva who purifieth thoughts purify our thought;
may the lord of speech to−day make sweet our utterance."

This hymn is not exclusive to just the Tāittirīya-saṁhitā́, it's found in the Māitrāyaṇa-saṁhitā́ too. Vājasaneya-saṁhitā́ has it too in 9.1, 11.7, and 30.1.

u/Dhvasra has pointed out: The mántra exhibits an interesting property of Vedic Sanskrit (Whitney 314d) from the stand-point of accent, 
by the way: Déva and Sávitar are treated as one unit syntactically, so only Déva exhibits the accent, 
whereas if the words referred to separate Gods then both words would retain the accent as usual for chains of vocatives at the beginning of a pā́da (Whitney 314e).

The line déva savitaḥ prá-suva is also found in the Pariṣecana practice.
