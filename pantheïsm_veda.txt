Vedic literature makes very clear that the Vedic religion was certainly not pantheïst, the concept of false gods are very much present. 

Take for example  R̥g-vedá  7.104.14 (yádi vāhám ánr̥tadeva ā́sa-), which says 'one who has false gods' will face the wrath of Agni. 

One who has foolish gods (mū́radevā), ought to be killed with bent necks (7.104.24) and literally burnt alive (10.87.2). 

The şişná-deva ''phallus-god" is forbidden from sacrifice (7.21.5) and killed by Indra (R̥V 10.99.3), much different from later hinduism. 

The anyá-vrata-s "people of other religions" are condemned and their death is desired (see R̥V 5.20.2, 8.70.11, 10.22.8).

Men who worshipped the Rakṣás-es (6.62.8), were the enemies of the Ā́rya-s, and their death was was desired. 

The Vedic religion was obviously not pluralist, and foreign 'gods' were evil demons to the Vedic Ā́rya-s and weren't accepted in their faith.
