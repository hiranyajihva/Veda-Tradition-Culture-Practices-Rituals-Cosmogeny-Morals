Vedic opinion on marriages between near blood relatives. 

The Şata-patha-brāhmaṇá has a verse that relates the the seperation of the spoons in the new moon sacrifice to the prohibition of marriage between near blood relations

tadvā etat | samāna eva karmanvyākriyate tasmādu samānādeva puruṣādattā cādyaśca jāyate idaṃ hi caturthe puruṣe tṛtīye saṃgacāmaha iti videvaṃ dīvyamānā jātyā āsata etasmādu tat
~ Şata-patha-brāhmaṇá 1.8.3.6 (https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-sanskrit/d/doc1051704.html)

Thus the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one and the same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband), 
and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk (gâtyâh) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, 'In the fourth (or) third man (I.e. generation) we unite 1.' 
And this is so in accordance with that (separation of the spoons).

THE ŚATAPATHA-BRĀHMAṄA ACCORDING TO THE TEXT OF THE MĀDHYANDINA SCHOOL by Julius Eggeling (https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-english/d/doc63146.html#note-e-34523)

The Şata-patha-brāhmaṇá Kāṇva says 'In the third man we unite, in the fourth man we unite' because the Kāṇva-s allow marriage from the 3rd generation.
