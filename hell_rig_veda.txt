In Şākala-saṁhitā́ 7.104.3, Indra and Soma, send the wicked to a deep dark pit that ''has no support", so that they never come back again. 
This can be interpreted as an eternal condemnation to an underworld. I think the word naraka 'hell' isn't found in the Şākala-saṁhitā́.

Later on in the same hymn (7.104.10) Agni sends thieves and robbers to their destruction, along with their offspring, 
in the next verse (11) all the three earths press them (the robber and his descendents) below the earth.

In 7.104.17 a female is condemned is sent downward into an endless cavern. The next line talks about the demons being destroyed, 
so I guess this female was a demon (?)

Other hymns in 104 talk about how false god worhshippers may be sent to destruction, but nothing about a dark underworld like in 3,10,11,17
